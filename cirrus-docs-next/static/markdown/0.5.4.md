* Updated footer to add more balanced padding at the top and bottom
* `card-title` now has a more subtle shadow.
* Subsections of `modal` now have padding of `1rem 3rem` to reduce clustering.

##### ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes
* Modal animation selectors now follow BEM conventions, ex: `modal-animated--zoom-in` instead of `modal-zoom-in`.
