Cirrus 0.6.1 is a minor update that addresses a few issues that were found in 0.6.0. It also corrects the column behaviors for `xs`, `sm`, etc. viewports to be more aligned with what is expected.

##### 🎉 Features

- Added rounded tag groups, added primary color to control themes, updated BEM notation for `tag`. [#49](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/pull/49)
- `tile` now inherits overflow rules. [4a4f276](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/4a4f2769466676898e1e6c7291804943fc475034).
- Using multiple column breakpoint classes will now respond accordingly. For example with the code example below, the div will span 8 columns for large screens and above but will span 4 columns for all screen sizes up to large. This is more in line with the behavior seen in most major frameworks. [e6a0fd2](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/e6a0fd26ca7ef33efe9d61097203d6281de00f57)

    ```html
    <div class="col-xs-4 col-lg-8"></div>
    ```

- Added BEM compliant class names for `card`. The old class names will still be supported but will be deprecated in a future release. [#51](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/issues/51)

##### 🐛 Fixes

- Removed extra space between label and `input-control` when the input contains an icon. [#47](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/pull/47)
- Fixed `tile` not overflowing correctly in smaller screens. [ad43bc2](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/ad43bc2147416d065d4cdaf06a650693826d6784).
- Fixed inconsistent `card` UI when certain heights caused by overflowing text content. [8859388](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/88593887d1f62719e8990e231994c5775b2aaf36)

##### 💥 Breaking Changes

- Shifted column sizes down one step: new `xs` that begins at 0px, old `xs` -> new `sm`, old `sm` -> new `md`, old `md` -> new `lg`, old `lg` -> new `xl`. This is to have better consistency with the majority of viewports we see today. [d2784b7](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/d2784b7a27985298ada702eb9ea15b9097b436a2)
